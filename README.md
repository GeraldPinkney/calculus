Summary/Core Objects
Calculus is a card game in a similar way to many other trumps games. 

*Game*
A game consists of 10 rounds, with each round being played with 1 less card (i.e. round 1 has 10 cards (and therefore 10 Tricks played in that round), round 2 has 9, etc).

*Round*
At the start of each Round cards are dealt, Bets made and then individual Tricks played out and the round scored.
